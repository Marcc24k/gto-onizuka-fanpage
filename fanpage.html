                <p> Hi. I'm <span class="onizuka">Eikichi Onizuka</span> and I'm going to be your new homeroom teacher. <span class="twentytwo">I'm 22 years old</span> and very single! I'm on a mission to become the greatest teacher ever. You know, when I was in high school, <span class="troublemaker">I was a troublemaker</span>. <span class="hardly">I hardly went to school.</span> Before I knew it, I was expelled. <span class="expelled">When I couldn't go anymore, was when I first realized,</span> <span class="goodthing">that school was a great thing.</span> There's a lot of friends and lots of fun things. <span class="onizuka">When I got this old, I wanted even more to go to school.</span> That's why I became a teacher. Because, if I become a teacher, <span class="twentytwo">I could stay in school until I die</span>, right? That's why I'm really happy now. I want you to be like that too. I want you to like school. <span class="tolate">Once it's over, it's too late.</span> </p>

                    You think you can just escape? Walk out of this world like it's some bad movie? It's too easy to make like a bird. To flap your wings as you chicken out after causing all these problems. The tough part's walking. Taking what comes along and walking right through it. That's what real people do.
