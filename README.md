Make: Using Bootstrap, build a responsive website for mega-fans of your favorite TV show. Name your folder [lastName]_Bootstrap. Your responsive site should be distinctly different on at least 2 different screen sizes and should include the following features:

 A jumbotron that features your favorite part of your favorite show ---check

 An image gallery that highlights certain episodes ---check

 A responsive navbar ---check 

 Find a way to include at least 5 glyphicons --ran into problems here with the bootstrap.min.css link overriding my css....tried a few things that didn't work.  I might end up using imgs instead of bootstrap glyphs.  

Set up a repository on GitHub and push your project to it. ---check
